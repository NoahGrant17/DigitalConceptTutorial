## History

In February 2008, GitHub was developed by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott 
Chacon. They utilized Ruby on Rails. The company, GitHub, Inc. is located in San Francisco.  They have a 
mascot, which is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like arms.
GitHub has been very popular.  As of June 2018, GitHub reports having over 28 million users and 57 
million repositories.  With that many users, GitHub was the largest host of source code in the world.
Because of its success, on June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced that it will acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion. 
The deal was just recently finalized on October 26, 2018. Even though Microsoft now owns GitHub, they 
plan to continue to operate independently.
