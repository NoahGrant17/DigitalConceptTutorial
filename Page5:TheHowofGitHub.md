Let’s take you through a step-by-step tutorial of using GitHub.  You need to a program to upload.  So 
let’s say you used the programming language C-sharp to write a code to organize your music library.
Now let’s upload that code onto GitHub!

**Step 1.**  Register to create a GitHub account.  You can go to this website: https://github.com/    

**Step 2.**  Once the account is created, click on the Repository tab.  The repository is basically where your 
project will be stored.  It is like a box that contains files, folders, images, videos, data sets, etc.  You 
should also create a README, which is just an informational file about your project. 
Once you click on the Repository tab, you can add and name your repository.  Write a short description,
 select the Public button and then select the button “initialize this repository with a README.”  Finally 
click the Create Repository.

**Step 3.**  Once the Repository is created, you can create a Branch.  A branch allows one to work on 
different versions of a repository at one time.  There is one main branch in your repository called the
 Master.  The cool thing about a branch is that you are actually making a “copy” of the Master at that 
point in time.  With this copy, you can experiment, make edits, etc., before actually committing them to 
the Master.  Also, if there is someone else who is making changes to the Master branch at the same 
time you are working on your branch, you could pull in those updates into your Master.
To create a branch in your repository, click on branch: master.  Just type in a branch name, readme-edits 
into the new branch text box, and then select Create Branch.

**Step 4.**  In this step, you will learn how to add changes to your new branch from Step 3.  You should be 
on your branch, readme-edit, which is the code-view.  Remember this is a copy of your Master.  Any 
saved changes are called commits.  Commits have an associated commit message, which explains why 
changes and edits were made.  This is helpful to other people contributing to your code.
Therefore, to make and commit edits, you first need to click on the README.md.file; Click the file view 
to edit; write a bit about your self in the editor, describe your changes in the commit message box and 
then click, “Commit” changes button.  The changes are made to just the README file on the readme-
edits branch.  The Master now has different content from the branch. 

**Step 5.**  In this step, you will learn about the open and merge pull requests. Pull requests are allowed 
after you have made changes in a branch that is different from the Master.  Pull Requests are cool 
because they allow others to collaborate with you on your project.  Opening a pull request allows you to 
propose your changes, request someone reviews them, and then pulls your edits, that is, merge your 
edits into their branch.  Once you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion.
To do a pull request, just click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New 
pull request button.  Finally, in the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-
edits, to compare with Master.  Click the Create Pull Request button.
Finally, in this last step, you can combine your changes by merging your readme-edits branch into the 
Master branch.  Just click the Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master and then 
click Confirm merge.  You can then delete the branch.
