So now that you know a little bit about GitHub and its history, why would you want to use it?  Besides 
being pretty cool, GitHub allows public sharing of your content.  You can share your software projects 
with the world and WOW future employers.  This is because the public can have access to the programs 
you develop.  On the other hand, you can make your program private and thus only share it with people 
you select.
Another reason to use GitHub is that it offers free accounts so it really does not cost you anything! 
A final reason to use GitHub is that you can accessed and manipulated other programs using the 
standard Git command-line interface.  There are over 57 million public repositories on the site.  All 
registered and non-registered users can browse the public repositories on the site.
